# Progress Log - 2024/04/07 - Aaaand We're Back
It's been a while, but unfortunately work has not been generous with leaving me time to work on this project. I've switched to Fedora as my daily OS, so getting my files hosted on this server is high priority. Unfortunately, Microsoft 365 integration on linux is abysmal, but I was shooting for self hosting anyway.

I've purchased four 12TB Seagate IronWolf drives for a whopping total 48TB for personal storage. I've also added several SSDs lying around to use for the VM instances I hope to create later. The Z-Pool we're creating today is dedicated solely for my file server (videos, music, backups, the works).

With our excuses and whatnot out of the way, lets jump into today's changes.
